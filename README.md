Abstract: This paper proposes a unifying cosmological framework wherein the graviton is not merely a quantum of the gravitational field, but the foundational unit of quantum gravitational entanglement. In this model, the universe originated from a single, accreting graviton—a quantum singularity that, upon reaching a critical density, transitioned through a quantum phase shift. This event released mass-energy entangled with newly formed spacetime, giving rise to the observable universe.
This paper hypothesizes that all black holes contain developing gravitons, which act as seeds of future universes, and that spacetime itself is emergent from a lattice of graviton entanglements. Quantum entanglement—across gravity and other forces—may arise from higher-dimensional or imperceptible shared topologies between quantum systems. When gravitational bonds within an over-dense graviton are overcome by compressed strong-force interactions, the graviton "breaks," triggering a localized inflationary expansion.
The framework introduces a duality of observer perspectives: internal observers, entangled within the newly formed spacetime, perceive an origin event; external observers, embedded in the parent spacetime, detect a non-entangled burst (e.g., through gravitational wave-like effects), but remain causally disconnected from the internal expansion. This suggests a multiversal structure rooted in graviton entanglement, where universes emerge within the interiors of black holes.
This paper outlines implications for black hole thermodynamics, quantum information, and potential observational signatures.
